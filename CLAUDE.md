# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a presentation repository for a hypothesis verification project about streamlining speaker experience through constrained content creation and sharing methods. The project tests whether limiting presentation creation to Markdown format and sharing via GitHub can reduce the burden on speakers.

## Repository Structure

- `speech/` - Directory containing all presentation files in Markdown format
- `images/` - Directory for storing images referenced in presentations
- `README.md` - Project description and rules for presentations

## Presentation Guidelines

When working with presentation files:

- All presentations must be in Markdown format and stored in the `speech/` directory
- Images should be stored in the `images/` directory and referenced relatively (e.g., `../images/filename.png`)
- Presentations should follow the 5-minute time limit format
- Use the existing `chiikawa.md` as a reference template for structure and formatting
- Target repository for sharing: https://github.com/raycast-jp/20250622_speechx/speech

## File Management

- When creating new presentation files, place them in the `speech/` directory
- When adding images, place them in the `images/` directory
- Follow the existing naming conventions (kebab-case for files)
- Ensure proper relative path references for images from speech files

## Content Standards

- Presentations should be comprehensive and well-structured
- Include proper headings, sections, and formatting
- Reference images appropriately with descriptive alt text
- Include sources and citations when applicable
